Setting up the React Application Page

We will need first to run NPM Nodemon
--This will be necessary for packages within the nodes to be used further in the application

We will then need to then install the tailwind dependencies
-- NPM  install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
-- NPM tailwind init -p

Changes will need to be made within the tailwind.config.js

--{module.exports ={
    content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
      }
      plugins: [],
};

importing the tailwind dependencies will need to be added to the index.css

-- @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;

IN THIS SPECIFIC GITHUB - Only the NODEMON will be necessary.
